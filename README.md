# frontend-project

### Description of project:

For this project you’ll be responsible for building out your own client side application. Client-side means that all of the code you’re writing will run inside of the user’s device, i.e. their web browser.

You will apply the lessons learned from previous weeks: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, DOM API, event handling, and AJAX to build an application from scratch, that interacts with a public API and provides some useful information to your users.

### Minimum Requirements:

Overall what we’re looking for from you is an application that accomplishes the minimum requirements below, and looks nicely styled and polished. Do not overcomplicate by adding more features than you can complete in a single day. You need to give yourself equal time to style your application so it looks good.

+ PROPOSAL: Approval of proposed project.
+ INTERACTION: Must have at least one event listener.
+ AJAX: Must have at least one AJAX call to an API.
+ DOM: Must manipulate the DOM based on a user’s interaction with your app.
+ POLISH: Your application should look clean and finished.
+ DEPLOY: Deploy to Github Pages or Surge

### Developer's Notes:

For this project I used the [Cocktail Database API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to allow users to search for a drink, display a list of results, and click once more for mixing instructions.

The app is mostly written in JavaScript with AJAX calls using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

As far as the front-end side of things, I incorporated the [Bootstap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library.
